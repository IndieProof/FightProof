F!GHTproof Whitepaper
( Pronounced, "Fight-Proof " )


A Player vs Player mobile game with the added bonus of a TRON Network main chain keeping tabs while using a DPoS hashing algorithm!
F!GHTproof is bringing it back old school with its arcade style of 1-on1 gameplay like that of classic titles, Street Fighter and Mortal
Kombat, but with a modern twist! F!GHTproof is to feature location-based gameplay with geo-location tagging of digital assets but also those same digital assets can be wagered in a Brawl Match. F!GHTproof's main attraction is its F!GHT-N!GHT Ecosystem which includes the Match Wager System, Match Explorer, and the Leaderboard. Players will now have the ultimate bragging rights of saying, "Put your money where your mouth is!"
