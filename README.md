Abstract
	
	We aim to combine the excitment of e-sports betting, the interactivity of geo-location mapping and augmented reality in the real world with the innovation and security of blockchain technology to bring you F!GHTproof. No longer is the act of using a controller to move a pixelated 2D or 3D character around in a virtual world to be considered just a hobbie. It is a whole new sport, or e-sport as this generation of Millennials calls it. Plus, hobbies don't pay anywhere near what the market capital for e-sports betting grossed in 2015. [1] According to research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, this boom in pro video gaming is fueled by $2.3 billion in online bets this year alone. It is expected that revenues from the online gambling games market will exceed $60 billion dollars by 2020. It is no wonder e-sports couples with online betting nicely to form the perfect equilibrium between both competition and online gambling, let alone encompassing with it a fourty percent (40%) growth year after year.
	With any sport comes competition and with competition comes gambling. Just as if one were to make a bet with a sports bookie on the outcome of a football or basketball game, one could now use many online platforms dedicated to placing those and similar bets to skip the dangerous bookies and gambling laws of their country. Newer platforms are now using certain digital assets like weapon skins, in e-sports games. [1] For CS:GO, the introduction of skins led to a thriving gambling market. People buy skins for cash, then use the skins to place online bets on pro CS:GO matches. Because there’s a liquid market to convert each gun or knife skin back into cash, laying a bet in skins is essentially the same as betting with real money. Not only is e-sport betting big this year, so is augmented reality and the use of blockchain technology in mobile games.
	The most recent, and historically famous, use of augmented reality (AR) in a mobile video game was that of Pokemon GO, a smart phone based title created for the iOS and Android platforms. Pokemon Go is an AR solutions based game built for both low and high end mobile devices giving way to a larger player market. [2] According to data gathered by online survey company, SurveyMonkey, Pokémon Go is the largest mobile game in U.S. history with an astounding 4.3 million (iOS) + 5.25 million (Android) = 9.55 million total daily U.S. users less than a week of its release. It would be the first of its kind to combine seamlessly, the real world with the virtual game world in such a matter that the player can easily loose track of time and space giving way to real world accidents and inguries. Even though word of those incidents spread across social media like a wild fire, players ignored those warnings, as more accidents continued to stack up. Accidents had risen so much so as to have many Public Service Announcements about he dangers of playing Pokemon GO, aired on television regularly.
	The first blockchain was conceptualised by  Satoshi Nakamoto and introduced to the world wide web 1.0 in 2008. Essentially,  a blockchain is a decentralized, or "autonomous", distributed ledger without any central control. Basically, a blockchain is like a continuously growing list of records, or "blocks", that is secured using cryptography and that runs autonomously and with no central server but rather distributed to an infinite number of nodes all over the world. Blockchain Technology now leads the way in fintech with peer-to-peer digital currencies that do not require a third party such as a bank to function. Blockchain Technology has also seen advancements in cyber security and the stream-lining of mass production to now be utilized by "mom and pop" businesses or smaller business outlets that once couldn't dream of such simplicity. Ultimately, blockchain tech has created a seamless avenues for extraordinary growth and profit.

1. What is F!GHTproof?

F!GHTproof is a Player vs Player mobile decentralized game application  for your smartphone or tablet. It combines the augmented reality and geo-location based digital asset features that made Pokemon Go popular. Now combine those with that of the monetizing and addictive wager betting features  of  CS:GO along with that of the legandry player vs player feature of Capcom's Street Fighter series or Midway's Mortal Kombat series... and you have a kick-@ss game dubbed, "F!GHTproof"!
Utilizing the innovative smart contract feature coupled with the solid network security and  scalibility attributes of the NEO blockchain allows our mobile game DApp to run, not only safe and secure from cheats and hacks, but also have the freedom and efficency to be completely autonomous, scailable and decentralized. This shall "future proof" its existance against any rules and regulations that call the immediate ban of such e-sport, digital asset - betting games.
When playing F!GHTproof on their mobile device, users will experience a ton of awesome features that will give them an easy and unique player experience like no other. Features like an augmented reality or AR character acquisition, complete character customization, geo-location based digital assets, single player campaign, and monetization of the TKO token through wagering of online Matches. The TKO token is not only our in-game currency but it will also have real world monetary value once it appears on the many exchanges.
We have included three montetizing features within F!GHTproof. Players not only get to challange their opponents in an all out player vs player (PvP) fight match where winner takes the pot, but spectators can also bet each other on which of the two players will win the selected match. This will create a whole new type of esports betting! The final and most important montetizing feature is our new F!GHTnodes that keeps our blockchain at distributed consensus while rewarding players with Power (PWR). PWR is used the same as GAS on the NEO blockchain.
2. Problem
Anytime money is involved in any situation, especially an online platform, people will always try and find away to cheat the system or tip it in their favor. On the other hand, we have our governments who will always try to find a way to regulate such activities in ways that may benefit themselves financially and if they cannot, well they will just find away to ban the whole thing altogether.  
There have been many instances of online casinos cheating their clients through the use of "rigged" digital slot machines and even "live" dealer tablets. Not only is cheating rampid in the online casino world but it also is happening in the realm of mobile game apps. Many android and iOS owners either root or jailbreak their smartphones to use apps like Lucky Patcher, Creehack, Freedom, LeoPlay Card, or AppSara to gain an advantage within a game or to be able to make free in-game purchases that would otherwise cost them money. 
When it comes to video game gambling and government rules and regulations, one current game comes to mind with its weapon skins in lieu of money being wagered in its online matches, CS:GO. Players participating in these type of CS:GO wager matches know that it can be very lucritive to the winner.  The act of wagering weapon skins in a match where the winner takes the loser's wagered weapon skin comes close to the thin line of illegal online gambling because that player has the option to sell that weapon skin on a variety of websites for real world currency such as U.S. fiat currency or cryptocurrency.  For the most part, such a platform is a magnet for underage gambling. With undersage gambling on the rise due to ease of accessibility, CS:GO has become extremely popular with the youth of this generation and the birth of e-sports. At any moment, any government can step in and regulate or ban the option to wager in CS:GO or other similar titles, killing the open online market for wagered digital asset sales. However, that may open the door to a new kind of blackmarket in its place.       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
3. Solution
Implementation of blockchain technology into the core of F!GHTproof create the perfect solution to counter act in-game cheating, digital asset manipulation and to also future-proof our title, F!GHTproof,  from any third party or government entity looking to completely shutdown or push strict regulations on it because of its combination of competitive esports and wager match gambling. To  build F!GHTproof, ontop of the XXXXX blockchain would create awhole new community or breed of crypto-gaming never seen before! A community made up of hardcore gamers and diehard crypto hodlers. F!GHTproof would be the first of its kindkind! A decentralized mobile game application coupled with a network that will consist of 2/3rds masternodes running a Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocol consesus mechanism.
We call these masternodes, F!GHTnodes, and just like an other masternode within crypto, in order to run a masternode and collect its payout of PWR, one must own and lockup a certain amount of PWR already. 
This partnership would allow F!GHTproof to be able to run autonomously, and without a central server, thus making this title unable to be shutdown or regulated by any form of government or censorship third party. The use of a blockchain protocol would also make in-game cheating in F!GHTproof near impossible because of its distributed digital ledger, a consensually shared list of synchronized  record blocks of each wager bet and Match outcome that cannot be altered or destroyed in anyway. That also goes for the ownership and control of in-game digital assets such as game characters, weapons, and contracts. They can neither be completely destroyed or lack evidence of a true proof of ownership.
4. Choosing a game engine and adding a new blockchain backbone
There are many game engines out now that we could choose from to complete our mobile game. Three AAA game engines come to mind when choosing which best suits our needs; Unity, Cryengine, and the Unreal Engine. We had three main points we had to hit when it came to selecting the which game engine to use.
	The game engine must forfill three needs: 
	1. Cost - Free Membership License
	2. Features - Includes AAA game engine features such as volumeric light/fog and                    		         particle system
	3. Community & Marketplace - A helpful community and large asset marketplace
	Unity was chosen to be our AAA indie game engine
Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies,[2] which is primarily used to develop both three-dimensional and two-dimensional video games and simulations for computers, consoles, and mobile devices. First announced only for OS X at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in 2005, it has since been extended to target 27 platforms and have six major version releases to date. Best of all, Pokemon GO was created with Unity. That reassures us of its potential to work with what kind of game we are going to build as Pokemon GO and F!GHTproof share a few similar important game play mechanics such as geo-location based digital assets and AR interactions with those digital assets.
Universal Fighting Engine: A Unity Asset
We have also purchased a license to Universal Fighting Engine (UFE) Source Code. We will be using this source code to build our MVP alpha to be used for investors to get an idea of what our game is to look and feel like. After we recieve our funding from our Token Generation Event, we will be developing our own source code from scratch to include the features and game mecanics that were not included with UFE.
4.1 NEO blockchain	
F!GHTproof will inheret the NEO blockchain technology into its core, alongside the Unity game engine. 
F!GHTproof  using the NEO blockchain structure coupled with the Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocol consensus mechanism means it shall have the current capability of 1000 transactions per second with the ability to also resolve conflicting transactions as well as reject double-spends. With F!GHTnodes making up two thirds of our network, network latency should no longer a limiting factor on transactional throughput. We understand that if we are to focus on data security,  network latency, and the overall scalability of our blockchain, NEO's blockchain technology is the way to go about it. Furthermore, our blockchain must have the use of smart contracts implemented in order to govern F!GHTproof's  game mechanics or "game laws" to further help prevent cheating and allow its distributed ledger to keep a record of each individual Match played out of all matches that are being played simaltaniously over the network. Another feature of the  blockchain used in F!GHTproof is the creation and use of TKO tokens based on NEO's NEP-5. This token differ in functionality when it comes down to its use both in-game and out in the real world.
In-game, the PWR token functions as a GAS to cover transaction fees. Since we are using the NEO blockchain, we are suseptable to the need and use for NEO's GAS. With that said, the GAS is used to send TKO token transactions and to launch smart contracts on our blockchain is called Power (PWR). While the TKO token is used to purchase virtual goods & services, deposited to join a Brawl Match, or to be traded on an external exchange. A player must deposit into a Brawl Match's wager pot, a certain amount of TKO tokens in order to join that online Match and have a chance at winning the whole pot! TKO can also be used in-game to purchase digital assets like character upgrades or weapons.  When it comes to the real world, both the TKO token and GAS can be very volatile in price, but it does carry over real world monetary value from its in-game worth!
4.2 Prevent Cheating
The implementation of the NEO blockchain into the core of F!GHTproof shall give a much needed boost of overall security to our mobile game decentralized application. When it comes to the final score of a match or the attempted illegal manipulation of a digital asset, F!GHTproof 's core database will be secure and tamper-proof due to it being hosted throughout the Inter-Planetary File System node structure and not on a single central server. Further securing F!GHTproof 's data from coruption is the actions of its own NEO blockchain, keeping a distributed ledger of the outcome or score of each Match completed since the launch of the game. Many details are recorded and catagorized within that pool of data such as that of each individual action (punch, kick, block) a player commits in-game during the Match. All of such information shall forever be fully transparent and viewable through our custom explorer. For example, each match shall be recorded in this or similar fashion:


 


4.2.1 F!GHTproof Match Explorer 
Similar to the original blockchain explorer, F!GHTproof Match Explorer takes the data to a whole new level, a level of complete detail. Included with our F!GHTproof  blockchain Explorer will be a Match Explorer. The Match tab, as it will be labeled, will give it's users access to a slew of fight data pertaining to that of each fighter in each individually saved Match.  Details of every Match since the launch of our game, will be stored in full transparancy for users to view and cycle through. With such a large amount of stored data, we will give the users of our database the option to search for a specific Match by either the unique Match Number, name of any participating fighter, or by the specific date and time that a Match took place. Once they find the specific Match they are looking for they can explore the details on how the fight played out down to a single punch thrown. They can also verify the points of the fight and if it adds up correctly to the winning fighter of that Match. This allows for new avenue of "side bets using points" and a clear explanation of a wager won or lost.
4.3 F!GHTnode
A F!GHTnode is a masternode on our blockchain network that uses a Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocol consesus mechanism. The benefit of setting up a       F!GHTnode is that you will receive a percentage of the transaction fees and other service charges that are charged by the system. F!GHTnodes validate the blockchain and in return pay the owner in GAS. In order to run a F!GHTnode, you must lock up 50,000 TKO tokens and have a dedicated computer or server and a  dedicated internet connection.

5. Competition
There will always be competition when money or gambling is involved. However,          F!GHTproof is so unique that there isn't any direct competition out yet. Sure there is competition for a few individual mechanics that make up our decentralized mobile game such as its game play using augmented reality and geo-location tagging of digital assets similar to that of Pokemon GO or having players battle it out over in-game competitive wager Matchs similar to that of CS:GO's skins betting. Ultimately, there currently is not any direct threats in the form of competition to F!GHTproof. To futher protect its longjevity, we have put a provitional patent on F!GHTproof's overall in-game mechanics and complete game structure.
5.1 Similar Product
Currently, there are no known similar products. There are however, a combination of multiple separate products that when combined together, make up a few similar game mechanics like that seen in our moble game DApp, F!GHTproof. Thus, we would categorize those products as being more of a general competition than a similar product or a direct threat to F!GHTproof.
5.2 General Competition 
General competition would be considered as a product that may have one or two similar features to F!GHTproof, but utilizing those features in a different manner when compared to    F!GHTproof. For example, both F!GHTproof and Pokemon GO share two similar features in game mechanics: Augmented Reality and Geo-Location mapping.
These two features may function in the same way but, in fact, are used in a completely different fashion. For example, Pokemon GO uses its augmented reality feature in order for the player to throw out poke' balls towards a little Pokemon creature displayed in 2d overlaping a live video feed of the real world viewed through your mobile device's back facing camera; with the hope of capturing it for their collection. Depending on your current real world gps location or geo-location, you can find special or rare Pokemon or visit PokeStops to refill your poke'balls. F!GHTproof uses its augmented reality feature to scan our real world environment looking for unique digital assets, such as a fight character or a gym bag full of goodies, spread out all over the world. In F!GHTproof you use our geo-location mapping to locate PvP Matchs, Urban Outfitters, Corner Gyms, Fight Clubs, and Blackmarkets.
5.3 How does F!GHTproof differ? 
There are many features that make F!GHTproof differ from its general competition. The main feature that differs F!GHTproof from its competition is that its core structure will be built upon new Blockchain technology. This will allow F!GHTproof to not only be secure from cheating and score manipulation but also be able to run autonomously and without a single central server. Instead, F!GHTproof's game and player files will be stored in special database nodes within the  Inter-Planetary File System. By decentralizing F!GHTproof, we will have future-proof its existance while giving our game DApp the freedom to grow its database with an infinite amount of users over time without having to worry about being regulated or even shutdown by any form of government agency.
6. Monetization
There are a few ways a user can monetize from the overall use of F!GHTproof's wager system. In-game monetization can be accomplished by betting on individual Brawl Matches using its wager token, TKO, as an in-game tender. 
Other ways to monetize besides the wager system is to aquire our utility token, PWR, by running a F!GHTproof masternode (F!GHTnode). The final way to aquire TKO tokens is through purchasing TKO tokens during our Pre-sale and our Main Sale Token Generation Events where TKO shall  be availiable at a discount for purchase (TGE). Thereafter, with the completion of the TGE, the TKO token will be available for purchase on many virtual exchanges.   
(Wager)
6.1 Match Wager
A Player-vs-Player (PvP) fight consists of two fighters who battle it out over a single round we call a Brawl Match or Match for short. In order to join a Match, the opponent must deposit the same amount of TKO tokens that the host, opponent fighter, has deposited as his Match Wager. In this Player-vs-Player battle, the winner of the Brawl Match takes home the whole pot of TKO tokens deposited. But wait, are you feeling lucky? Players can also sweaten the pot by throwing in extras like digital assets such as clothing. weapons, etc. or even the ultimate prize, Fighter ownership via Brawler Contracts! Win the Match and take their Fighter!
6.2 Spectator Wager
Each Brawl Match will have the option for players to join in on the Match, not as a fighter, but as one of the Spectators. Only four Spectators will be allowed to join in and watch the action without any interaction with either opponent. However, they can converse between themselves via the in-game chat. Spectators can also wager amoung themselves on which opponent is going to win the Match. The first Spectator to join the Brawl Match will have the duty of setting a minimum and maximum deposit amount for the remaining three Spectator seats.
6.3 Third Party Wager 
Each active and future Brawl Match will be posted in the Wager section, under the Third Party Wager tab.  Anyone who wants to bet on a Brawl Match but doesn't care to spectate or participate in the Match directly, will still have the option to wager their TKO tokens against other players wagers . Similar to PvP and Spectator Wager, Third Party Wager also has a TKO pot in each Brawl Match that anyone can participate in just as long as they meet the minimum deposit requirements set forth by the first, Third Party Wager deposit.
6.4 Side Bet - Points
All of the extensive fight data of each of the Brawl Matches are recorded onto the blockchain and displayed in full transparancy in our F!GHTproof  Explorer, under the Match tab. Such data displayed is that of a point system that represents each action done by both fighters: punch, kick, and/or block. Players can wager on side bets that are based off that point system. (Still in debate on whether to implement Side Bets).
(PoF)
6.5 Chosen To Mint
The winning Fighter of each Brawl Match are entered into a pool and one Fighter is randomly selected to aid in achieving distributed consenses, thus forging a new block and minting 5 TKO for themself. For more information please refer to PoF Protocol.
7. Indepth Concept of Fight-Proof 
	Outline of F!GHTproof  game mechanics -- First Run
7.1 Start a new game 
Upon launch of F!GHTproof , the player will have to set up their On-line Fight Club Profile. The player can sign-in and load a previously saved Fight Club Profile or register a brand new Fight Club Profile onto the Blockchain database. A Fight Club Profile is your fighters' account. All information of this account is stored on the IPFS. It houses your customized fighters (up to 5), in-game TKO wallet, Brawl Match History, Gym Locker, and in-game message box.
The player will be transfered to the Game Settings page once their Fight Club Profile is loaded. In Game Setting the player has the options to change the default in-game graphics or the default controller input. 
Finally, the player will be brought to their dashboard where they can select to start a new Single Player Campaign, join or host a Brawl Match, enter the Wager Area, or search the the real world for goodies and new fighters using geo-locational mapping and AR. No matter which direction you choose to go, an in-game tutorial box will appear to guide the player the rest of the way. The player will have the option to turn off or skip the in-game tutorial and hint system altogether. It will not effect game play in any way.
7.1.1 Single Player Campaign
F!GHTproof will also include a single player campaign. In this campaign, the player will battle our in-game Artificial Inteligence or AI for TKO tokens. The player does not need to put up and of their hard earned TKO tokens in order to fight AI opponents. The single player campaign is infinite, that is there are no levels to climb, the player can find an infinite number of matches via geo-location. In order to join these matches, the player must physically travel in the real world to the match location labeled by the gps. As an added bonus, any one of these single player campaign matches agaisnt the AI can be randomly chosen to recieve bonus PWR  at any given time. This is due entirely to the storage of TKO tokens within your wallet.
7.1.2 Multiplayer Brawl Match
A Player-vs-Player Brawl Match puts two human opponents against one another in a single Match where the winner takes all. There are no opponent ladders to climb or a certain amount of AI Matches to win inorder to beat the game. That is because there is not an end to playing Multiplayer Brawl Matches. There will always be live human opponents to play. Whether it be through the use of 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, or Wi-Fi Direct. A player can find a Brawl Match to join by reviewing his geo-location map which would label an opponent hosting a live Brawl Match located in the real world with the option of allowing web join instead of only allowing in person.
7.2 In-game Tutorial 
When beginning a new game, there will be a pop up screen with hints and instructions on how to play the game. This can be skipped or turned on completely by checking the small box in the lower right hand corner and clicking the skip button.
7.2.1 Choose Fighter
Every player can have a max of five fight characters in their Fight Club per individual Account Profile. When choosing a fighter, a player will have not only the gender to choose from but they will have the option to choose between three different race types: Human, Cyborg or Creature. There are special and rare fighters a player can aquire but they will be spread throught the world. For example, the rarest fighter is Tokanashi Niche'moto, aka Ninja, who can defeat an opponent with a single blow! There is only one of him and he cannot be customized. All other fight characters can be completely customized both physically and mentally. Physical appearnce can be customized by ethnicity, gender, clothing, hair, and body type. When it comes to their mental customization, we are refering to their skill set and fight attributes. You can make your character stronger when it comes to health so he or she can take more hits in order to get hurt or stronger when it comes to dishing out punches and kicks to your opponents in order to do more damage. These are just a few of the attributes. When it comes to fight skills, a player must in-roll their fighter in a Corner Gym where they will learn new attacks to add to their arsenal. In order to aquire new fighers, a player must use their in-game map (geo-location mapping) and their mobile screen (Augmented Reality) to locate and sign new fighters they find in the real world. In order to sign a new fighter, a player must have a Brawler Contract. These contracts can be purchased with TKO tokens from the Black Market. Each player gets one free Brawler Contract when they start the game for the first time.
	Geo-Location 
Geo-locational mapping uses your mobile devices GPS in combination with Google Maps in order to bring you your in-game map which is a mix between the real world and the game world. You will use this function to locate and aquire new fighters, gear, important locations, Brawl Matches, and surprizes like a Golden Gym Bag. 
		Web Join
The Web Join option is an option a host of a Brawl Match has to allow opponents, not in his general vicinity, to join his Match via the world wide web.
	Augmented Reality 
Augmented Reality (AR) is used along side your in-game map with its geo-locational mapping. Using your mobile devices screen to view the game world, as if looking through a window into a parallel universe, to see and interact with non-player game characters (NPC) or to pick-up items like weapons, power-ups, contracts, or gym bags. Ultimately, you will use AR to find your five fight characters.
	Use of Inventory 
You will have a Gym Bag that functions as your inventory storage for keeping items you find in a safe place to use at a later time. Your Gym Bag is limited in space but can be upgraded to carry more items at a cost of TKO tokens.
		Brawler Contract 
These are the most important of all contracts in the game. Each individual Brawler Contract represent ownership of one of your five fighters. Which ever fighter you aquired by having sign that contact will be labeled within that contract so you can't mix them up. These contracts, along with its fighter, can be sold on the Black Market for TKO tokens. The contract would not only include the fight character, but all of his or her skills, weapons, and other customizations.
7.2.2  Your first match 
A player's first match will be fought against an AI opponent before the game opens up to allow the player to join live Brawl Matches. This is to allow the player to have time to learn the controls and gain abit of TKO tokens to use in future Brawl Match deposits. 
	PvP and AI 
A player will fight an easy artificial Intelegence opponent in a single round. No matter if the player wins or loses, they will recieve 10 TKO tokens for participating. They can come back and fight the AI at any time but only the winner is rewarded the TKO wager pot which means if they lose, they lose thier wager deposit.
7.2.3 TKO Tokens
The TKO token, a virtual currency and utility token, is the life blood of F!GHTproof .  The TKO token is used as in-game currency to purchase clothing, supplies, weapons, contracts and fight attributes that make your Fighter unique to you. The TKO token is also used in Match bounty rewards as an incentive to intice players to deposit their TKO tokens. Inorder to join a player's PvP Brawl Match and challenge their fighter to a "winner takes all" fight, the opponent must match the bounty reward to join the Match. The winner of the Match shall recieve the entire bounty reward or Pot of TKO tokens. The PvP betting style differs greatly from our in-game, single player campaign.
The TKO token can easily be aquired in bunch of different ways. The first way to aquire TKO is during our Token Generation Event where TKO shall  be availiable at a discount for purchase (TGE). Thereafter, with the completion of the TGE, the TKO token will be available for purchase on many virtual exchanges. You can also aquire TKO tokens by betting on the outcome of fight Matches. You have the option to bet either as a challanger, Spectator, or Third Party Wager -- the amount of TKO tokens differs from which pot you choose. The final way to aquire TKO tokens is through exchanging of PWR recieved from F!GHTnodes.
7.2.4 Character Customization & Team Mgmt.
In F!GHTproof , the player starts off with a single Brawler Contract that they must use to aquire their first Fighter, a character that they can completely customize its physical appearence, fighting attributes, and weapon inventory to their liking by spending TKO tokens in either the Urban Outfitter, the Corner Gym, Fight Club, or the Black Market. Thanks to the blockDAG, this character, in its entirety, can never be destroyed and will be the sole property of the player unless ownership is traded to with another player. 
	Urban Outfitters 
A virtual clothing and accessories store located in the game world can be easily accessed by viewing your in-game map and traveling to the store's location in the real world utilizing your mobile GPS and Google Maps.
	Corner Gym 
A virtual gym used to upgrade your fight character's skills such as learning new kicks and punches which do more damage to your opponent. You must use in-game map and traveling to the gym's location in the real world utilizing your mobile GPS and Google Maps.
	Fight Club 
The Fight Club acts as your clan or gang. You can only have five of your own fighters but you can join and combine with other players to create your own Fight Club. Players in the same Fight Club can share TKO and other resources with all members. They can open up a Fight Club TKO Fund which would allow any member to withdraw TKO to use in upgrading their fighters, etc.
	Black Market 
A virtual peer-to-peer market where players can sell their Brawler Contracts and other items, attributes, and resources to one another. This is also the only place to purchase weapons to use in your Brawl Matches. 
7.2.5 Match Select 
A player is brought to the Match selection screen when they starts the game and select the Multiplayer option. Match selection screen labels all of the Web Join Brawl Matches that are available to join as well as the option to create and host your own Brawl Match. A player can also access the Wager tab from within this screen.
7.2.6 Betting 
Players have the option to bet or wager TKO tokens within F!GHTproof. More information can be found on betting by viewing the Monetization section within this Whitepaper or by visiting the Wager tab within the Match selection screen
8. Smart Contracts & Host Options
The many laws of our decentralized game application, F!GHTproof, are governed by smart contracts to further prevent cheating and game manipulation. However, the main goal of a smart contract within F!GHTproof is to function as not only a Match "Referee", keeping track of points accumulated or lost by a player during a fight, but also as the Match "Cashier", who is to collect and also pay out the TKO tokens wagered by the fighters. Three things must happen inorder for a Match to begin thus allowing two players to battle it out. A single smart contract is key in these matters. First, a player must configure the Match using the available host menu options to set the following: 
⦁	TKO token amount required to "match" the host's wager.
⦁	The minimum level of fighter able to join.
⦁	A fight's map location (either in a multiplayer match server room or gps labeled within the real world using geo-location tagging).
⦁	Set a time and date that the Match is to open to join and begin.
⦁	Is the Match is public or is the Match private and by invite only. 
 Secondly, once the host menu options are set, the smart contract is automatically written and put into effect from the moment the Finalize Match button is pressed. The third and final requirement needed inorder for a Match to begin is for both the opponents to deposit their required TKO tokens into the smart contract of that specific Match. Which can easily be accomplished with a single press of the deposit button located within the Match waiting room. The deposit functions the exact same way one would deposit Ethereum into an Ethereum ICO contract but in a much more simplified manner. We chose to go this route instead of the familiar "copy and paste" of the contract address into the recepient address field of our in-game wallet. Just that simple change alone can save accidents waiting to happen. 
9. Game Data Storage 
F!GHTproof game database and users' data is divided among their mobile device's local storage and our node servers located on the Inter-Planetary File System. Which location each bit of data is stored depends on what that data entails. 
9.1 Local Device Storage 
Data that is stored within the player's mobile device's local storage is that of the game engine core database, maps, base models, sprites, textures, sounds, and anything else that is visual and that could have an adverse effect of fps or frames per second. That last thing our game would need would be lag. Within the locally stored database would be a few much needed API protocols that would connect the local database with the blockchain, its Score Book, and a player's more larger game files. Large game files would include customized fighter models, fighter and weapon skins, player avatar patches and the many Fight Club clan flags that will be stored on the nodes servers running within the Inter-Planetary File System or IPFS. 
9.2 Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) 
The Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) is a hypermedia distribution protocol created to make the web faster, safer, and more open. The IPFS is designed to provide a decentralized alternative to the current http protocol that is not only censorship resistant but also faster download speeds and more efficent network. IPFS is a peer-to-peer network run by multiple nodes that store files that are submitted to the network and given a unique cryptographic hash. Each unique cryptographic hash allows the IPFS network to automatically delete duplicates and track version history for every file stored within any of its nodes. That data is also time stamped using blockchain technology and than stored on its decentralized distributed ledger inorder to be referenced back at any point in time.
This creates a sort of beneficial relationship between the IPFS and blockchain technology. Since blockchain technology is not fit to store large amounts of data, the IPFS will be used by F!GHTproof's blockchain or "score book" to record and display its publicly accessible databases of PvP fight Match history and many other kinds of in-game content. Historic versioning prevents information from being easily erased. 
In order for a player to see their opponents customized fight character, a certain specific player model, texture, and animation files must be downloaded onto the players device. Each and everytime a player connects to a new Brawl Match, they must download a few character customization files from the F!GHTnodes storing them (This also applies to all Spectators of any Brawl Match). This must be done inorder for other players to view your custom fighter model. Without that model being downloaded onto the opponents mobile device, they would just see a base model of a fighter model, one inwhich has yet to be customized. The same goes for any and all customized game material. However, to save space on a players' local device storage, those character files will be downloaded to the users' temp folder so that they can be deleted after the Brawl Match is completed or after exiting the game application. 

10. Network Connectivity 

	10.1 Mobile Data, Wi-Fi, and Mesh 
F!GHTproof will utilize three or four internet connection outlets of a player's mobile smart phone to connect them with other players online. Those connective functions are: Mobile Data, Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi Direct and maybe also a Mesh Network.
Internet is needed to connect players, via multiplayer, to one another so they can battle each other in Brawl Matches for TKO tokens. Internet is also needed to connect F!GHTproof to the blockDAG in order to keep the Score Book uptodate and to prevent cheating. Basically, the internet is needed so that F!GHTproof can run correctly. The only thing that the internet is not needed for within F!GHTproof is its Single Player Campaign. Although, when a player first downloads and starts F!GHTproof, they will need to connect to the internet once inorder to download the rest of the game files as what is downloaded from the appstore is an installer file. An installer file is uploaded to the appstore because the actual size of F!GHTproof is quite large in conparison to the average file size of all applications on the appstore. 
There are different use cases for certain connections when it comes to game mechanics. The mobile data network (4G/4GLTE) and Wi-Fi are used for connecting players who live all over the world while the connections of Wi-Fi Direct and a Mesh Network or used for connection local players who are in proximity from one another.
The option to connect players all over the world allows for more opportunity to participate in or wager on more Brawl Matches, form larger Fight Clubs, or to ultimately obtain more TKO tokens that a player could if they only had access to local matches in proximity. This keeps a game play constant and ever growing and expanding with new players everyday.
To connect locally over Wi-Fi Direct or a Mesh Network is used  when a reliable internet connection is not available or when a challange or its wager becomes more personal. For example, to have Brawl Matches with friends where winner not only gets the pot of TKO tokens but also must play for the round of beers tonight!
